# Unity Scripts
Here is a collection of potentially useful Unity scripts I've made.

* [InstantiatePrefabsCardinalDirection](https://github.com/soda3x/InstantiatePrefabsCardinalDirection)
> Simple script for instantiating Prefabs in Unity facing a cardinal direction.

* [SimplePlayerCollider](https://github.com/soda3x/SimplePlayerCollider)
> Unity project showing how OnCollisionEnter and OverlapSphere can be used with GameObject tags.
